                <h2>Fitness</h2>
                <p>I know this is going to sound very boring but i dont have many interest<br>
                    All I do is go to the gym and work. in school i just focused on studying <br>
                    the only thing that i've ever been interested in was wrestling and staying in shape <br>
                    So it really boils down to me loving fitness, i go to the gym everyday! <br>
                    I track my calories, I track my lifts and I make sure i'm always in shape!</p>
