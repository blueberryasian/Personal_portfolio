                <h2>Born and Raised in North Park</h2>
                <p> From 0-9 years of age I lived with my parents <br>
                At 10 years old my mother and I moved to Escondido where I finished Elementary school, middle school and High school.<br>
                In High school, I was Captain of the wrestling team and focused on my studies. Which allowed me to graduate with Honors! <br> 
                Right after High school I became a Real estate agent and a year into my Real estate Journey I had met the love of my life! <br>
                But the problem was....she was moving to Fullerton to attend CSUF so I had to find a way to move with her to Fullerton! <br>
                I gave up my Real Estate career and started looking into other industries and eventually found coding and learned about Coding Bootcamps! <br>
                Which brings us to present day I am now attending the Coding Temple bootcamp in hopes of finding a fulfilling career in Tech <br>
                and being able to provide for myself and my girlfriend!</p>
